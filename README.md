# Webscaping-project for data analyst jobs
I used skills acquired  to  gather data from the TimesJobs website and save it in a CSV file.
I have uploaded two Python files.
The file get_all_skills.py will create a CSV file with all the jobs with the data analyst tag.
The file get_specific_skills.py will create a CSV file with jobs with data analyst tags plus the specific tags that will be asked as input.
The CSV files generated have three columns: Company name, required skills, and link to the job description.
